Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements Total Number of Calls: Track and display the total number of calls received by our call center over a specified period.

Total Call Duration in Hours: Understand the total amount of time our call center staff spends on calls in hours, aiding in resource allocation and capacity planning.

Total Call Duration in Minutes: Similar to the total call duration in hours, this KPI provides the total call time but in minutes, offering a more granular view of call durations.

Average Call Duration in Minutes: Calculate and display the average call duration in minutes to assess the efficiency of our agents. This metric helps identify trends in call handling.

Response Time Percentage: Display the percentage of calls answered within a predefined time frame, indicating our ability to provide prompt service and contributing to customer satisfaction.

Charts Requirements Total Call by Day (Column Chart): Display a column chart showing the total number of calls on each day over a specified time period.

Total Calls by State (Filled Map Chart): Create a filled map chart visualizing the total number of calls received from different states or regions.

Top Reason for Calls (Tree Map): Implement a tree map chart to display the top reasons for calls. Each box in the tree map represents a call reason.

Total Calls by Channel (Donut Chart): Showcase the distribution of calls by different communication channels using a donut chart.

Total Calls by Sentiment (Column Chart): Utilize a column chart to illustrate the distribution of calls by sentiment (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

Total Calls by Call Centre (Bar Chart): Create a bar chart presenting the total number of calls handled by each center or department.

#Dashboard 2: Grid 

Include a grid view to provide tabular data representation, allowing users to see detailed information about calls, such as timestamps, caller information, call duration, and call reasons. This grid view complements the visual representations provided by the charts and enhances data exploration and analysis capabilities.
